<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e present the model of Markov decision processes and introduce the outline of a course on reinforcement learning.</p>

The reference book and key inspiration for this course and for reinforcement learning in general is the book by [Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html) (it can be downloaded for free at that address).
The reason for these lecture notes to exist is that we will have a more theoretical focus and we will provide toy code to play with the different algorithms.

#### Part 1: Multi-armed Bandits

The [blog post]({{ '/blog/armed_bandits_upper_bound' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
The main point of this part is to provide a full proof for the analysis of the UCB algorithm for multi-armed bandits.

#### Part 2: Markov decision processes and dynamic algorithms

See the corresponding [blog post]({{ '/blog/dynamic_algorithms_MDP' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

#### Part 3: Monte Carlo approaches, temporal differences and off-policy learning

See the corresponding [blog post]({{ '/blog/Monte_Carlo_MDP' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

#### Part 4: Two-player games

This [post]({{ '/blog/monte_carlo_tree_search' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) constructs the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm in the context of two-player games.

Look at the [github repository](https://github.com/nathanael-fijalkow/TicTacToe_RL) for implementations of some algorithms solving Tic-Tac-Toe.

#### Part 5: Deep reinforcement learning
