<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his post gathers some information about applying to CNRS for a permanent researcher position (chargé de recherche).
It includes links to my files for the two times I applied.
</p>

**Disclaimer**: The information below are gathered through experience and may not be fully accurate.

The official website is [here](http://www.dgdr.cnrs.fr/drhchercheurs/concoursch/default-en.htm), but you will find most relevant information [here](http://cn6.fr/), called the "section".
They in particular announce how many positions there are, and whether there are "special" positions (called "fléchées").

The "section" receives about 200 applications. There are three phases: 
* "admission à parcourir", (about 100 names) 
* "admis à poursuivre", selection for the interview (roughly 40 to 50 names) 
* "admissibilité" is the ranking given by the scientific committee, a week or two after the interviews (roughly 5 to 10 names in the first list, and another 5 to 10 in the waiting list)
* "admission" is the very final ranking agreed by the administrative committee, which may differ from the previous one.

**Labs**. For applying you need to choose three labs where your research proposal fits.
**It is very important to visit these labs** somewhere in October / Novembre / December, meaning write to the researchers there, send your research programme, and offer to give a talk.
Each lab is asked to send a letter about which candidates they would be happy to hire. This is of course only a consultation, 
but it is very important as it helps the CNRS committee to see how you will in effect integrate the labs.

**Recommendation letters**. There is a limit on how many you are supposed to send (I think it is 3), please check carefully on the website of the section,
as well as the procedure for sending them out (for now, directly to the head of the section, this may change in the future!). 

**Documents**. You have to write two documents: "past" and "future". Past presents your research output so far, and Future explains which directions you would like to take if hired.
There is no recommended format, but there are non-strict page limits (I think 6 to 10 pages).

For your information, here are mine (in French, sorry!):
* [travaux effectués 2016]({{ '/docs/travaux_effectues_2016.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
* [projet de recherche 2016]({{ '/docs/projet_recherche_2016.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
* [travaux effectués 2017]({{ '/docs/travaux_effectues_2017.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
* [projet de recherche 2017]({{ '/docs/projet_recherche_2017.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

**Slides**. When I applied the format was 15mn presentation of your research plus 5mn presentation of your research project, with additional 15mn questions. This may change as well.

For your information, here are mine (in French, sorry!):
* [slides 2016]({{ '/docs/FIJALKOW_CNRS_06_03.pdf.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
* [slides 2017]({{ '/docs/2017-02-15' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
