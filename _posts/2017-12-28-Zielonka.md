<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his post revisits Zielonka's algorithm.
One of the point of this post is to extract from Zielonka's algorithm the notion of signatures, which is the key to the correctness proof for 
the small progress measure algorithm of Jurdzi&#324;ski.</p>

<p>Zielonka's algorithm is the oldest algorithm for parity games, the simplest, and also in practice the best.
Its analysis actually reveals even more: as a by-product, we will obtain determinacy, positional determinacy and the existence of progress measures.
Note that we do not assume anything here, the proofs are built from (almost) first principles.</p>

<p>One can take advantage of the symmetry of parity games to only deal with one case.
Here we will not do that, and there is a good reason for that: in addition to the correctness of the algorithm
we will derive the existence of progress measures for Eve. 
Breaking the symmetry here is necessary, since progress measures focus on one player.</p>

<p>We fix some notations. Let $\G$ be a finite parity game with priorities $[1,d]$.
The parity condition is satisfied by a play if the **maximal** priority seen infinitely often is even.
The two players are Eve and Adam, she controls the vertices depicted by circles and he controls the vertices depicted by squares.
We let $W_E(\Parity)$ denote the set of vertices from which Eve has a winning strategy, and $W_A(\Parity)$ for Adam.</p>

<p>The algorithm proceeds recursively on $d$.</p>

### If the largest priority is even

> **Claim:** 
$W_E(\Parity)$ is the greatest fixed point of the function $Y \to W_E(\Parity(\<\ d)\ \WeakUntil\ (d \cap Y))$

In words: $W_E(\Parity)$ is the largest set of vertices $X$ such that from $Y$ Eve has a strategy ensuring that 
* either the priority $d$ is never seen, in which case the parity condition is satisfied with lower priorities,
* or the priority $d$ is seen, in which case $Y$ is reached.

Algorithmically, we compute a non-increasing sequence of sets $Y_0 \supseteq Y_1 \supseteq \cdots$,
such that $Y_{k+1} = W_E(\Parity(\<\ d)\ \WeakUntil\ (d \cap Y_k))$ until reaching the greatest fixed point.

</figure>

**Proof:**
The fact that $W_E(\Parity)$ contains the greatest fixed point follows from the observation that any fixed point $Y$ is contained in $W_E(\Parity)$.
Indeed, if $Y$ is a fixed point, the strategy described above ensures parity: either it visits finitely many times $d$,
and then from some point onwards the parity condition is satisfied with lower priorities, or it visits infinitely many times $d$,
and then the parity condition is satisfied because $d$ is maximal and even.

The fact that $W_E(\Parity)$ is included in the greatest fixed point follows from the fact that it is indeed a fixed point,
which is easy to check.

### If the largest priority is odd

> **Claim:** 
$W_E(\Parity)$ is the least fixed point of the function $X \to W_E(\Parity(\<\ d) \cap \safe(d)\ \WeakUntil\ X)$

In words: $W_E(\Parity)$ is the smallest set of vertices $X$ such that from $X$ Eve has a strategy ensuring that 
* either the priority $d$ is never seen, in which case the parity condition is satisfied with lower priorities,
* or the priority $d$ is seen, in which case $X$ is reached.

Algorithmically, we compute a non-increasing sequence of sets $X_0 \subseteq X_1 \subseteq \cdots$,
such that $X_{k+1} = W_E(\Parity(\<\ d) \cap \safe(d)\ \WeakUntil\ X_k)$ until reaching the least fixed point.

<figure>
	<img src="{{ '/images/parity_odd.svg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=""> 
	<figcaption>The odd case</figcaption>
</figure>

**Proof:**
The fact that $W_E(\Parity)$ contains the least fixed point follows from the fact that it is indeed a fixed point,
which is easy to check.

The fact that $W_E(\Parity)$ is included in the least fixed point is the interesting non-trivial bit.
It follows from the observation that any fixed point $X$ contains $W_E(\Parity)$.
To prove this, we show that $V \setminus X \subseteq W_A(\Parity) \subseteq V \setminus W_E(\Parity)$.
Note that here we are not relying on the determinacy of parity games: the second inclusion is very simple and always true,
it only says that Eve and Adam cannot win from the same vertex.

Indeed, if $X$ is a fixed point, from $V \setminus X$ Adam has a strategy ensuring that
* either the priority $d$ is never seen, in which case the parity condition is violated with lower priorities,
* or the priority $d$ is seen, in which case $V \setminus X$ is reached.

This strategy violates parity: either it visits finitely many times $d$,
and then from some point onwards the parity condition is violated with lower priorities, 
or it visites infinitely many times $d$, and then the parity condition is violated because $d$ is maximal and odd.


### To be continued!
<!--
> **Theorem:** The winning regions of $\text{Parity}$ and $L$ coincide.

**Proof:** This relies on the positional determinacy of parity games.
A positional strategy ensuring $\text{Parity}$ also ensures $\text{AllEvenCycles}$, hence $L$.
Conversely, a positional strategy ensuring the complement of $\text{Parity}$ also ensures $\text{AllOddCycles}$, hence the complement of $L$.

It follows that solving the parity game is equivalent to solving a safety game of size $n \times |L|$, where $|L|$
is the number of states of a **deterministic** automaton recognising $L$.
Since solving a safety done can be done in linear time, this gives an algorithm whose running time is polynomial in $n$ and $\|L\|$

#### In the remainder of this post we explain that:
1. the [small progress measure](#small_progress) of Jurdzi&#324;ski is a solution of the separation problem with $\|L\| = O(n^{\frac{d}{2}})$,
2. the [succinct progress measure](#succinct_progress) of Jurdzi&#324;ski and Lazi&#263; is a solution of the separation problem with $\|L\| = O(n^{\log(d)})$,
3. the [power counting](#power_counting) of Calude et al is a solution of the separation problem with $\|L\| = O(n^{\log(d)})$.



### <a name="small_progress">The small progress measure algorithm</a>
The fact that the small progress measures form a solution of the separation problem was essentially shown by Julien Bernet, David Janin, and Igor Walukiewicz, in the paper 
[Permissive strategies: from parity games to safety games](www.labri.fr/perso/igw/Papers/igw-perm.ps).
By essentially I mean that the separation problem is hinted at in the conclusion, but the definitions of $\text{AllEvenCycles}$ and $\text{AllOddCycles}$ do not appear.

The proof we give here is not a direct adaptation of their proof. It is not fair to say that it is simpler, nor better. It is simply *different*.

We construct a (deterministic) safe automaton recognising a language $L$ solving the separation problem.
The states of the automaton are $d/2$-tuples of integers in $[n] = \set{0,\ldots,n}$,
they are numbered $1,3,\ldots,d-1$.
For a tuple $x$ and a priority $p$, we let $x(p)$ denote the $p$ component of $x$.
The initial state is the tuple containing only $0$, written $x_0$.
We order tuples lexicographically; more precisely, we let $$\le_p$$ denote the lexicographic order restricted to the components larger than or equal to $p$,
and $<\_p$ the strict version. The order $\le_p$ is called the $p$-order.
The transition function is as follows: from the tuple $x$, reading a vertex $v$ of priority $p$, the next tuple $x'$
is the smallest satisfying: 
* if $p$ is even, then $x \le_p x'$,
* if $p$ is odd, then $x <\_p x'$.

A more mechanistic definition is as follows: 
* if $p$ is even, then the new tuple is the same as $x$, but all priorities smaller than $p$ are reset to $0$,
* if $p$ is odd, then the new tuple is the same as $x$, but the $p$ component is incremented by $1$ and all priorities smaller than $p$ are reset to $0$.
If a component cannot be incremented, it is reset, and the component just above is incremented. If no components can be incremented, the automaton rejects.

Formally, the transition function is $$\delta : [n]^{\frac{d}{2}} \times V \to [n]^{\frac{d}{2}}$$, inducing $$\delta : V^* \to [n]^{\frac{d}{2}}$$.
For a word $w$ and a tuple $x$, we let $\delta(x,w)$ denote the tuple reached after reading $w$ from $x$, if defined.
Then, $\delta(w)$ is $\delta(x_0,w)$.

The automaton is safe: all states are accepting, and if a transition is undefined, the automaton rejects.

**Lemma:**
1. $\text{AllEvenCycles} \subseteq L$
2. $L \cap \text{AllOddCycles} = \emptyset$

**Proof:**
We start by proving the second item: it follows from the well known observation that if $w$ is an odd cycle, then $x <\_p \delta(x,w)$.
Indeed, along the cycle the $p$ component is either not touched, when a lower priority is visited, or incremented.
Consider now the largest priority appearing infinitely many times, and assume it is odd: there are infinitely many odd cycles with this priority, 
and from some point on they induce an increase in the corresponding tuple, which eventually results in the automaton rejecting.

We now prove the first item. 
It follows from the following invariant: for every $w \in V^*$ which is not rejected by the automaton, $w$ has a suffix of the form $w_{d-1} \cdots w_3 w_1$, where 
for $p \in \set{1,3,\ldots,d-1}$, the priority $p$ appears at least $\delta(w)(p)$ times, and no larger priority appears in $w_p$.

Assume the invariant holds for $w$, and we read a vertex $v$ of priority $p$, there are two cases:
* if $p$ is even, we construct the suffix $w_{d-1} \cdots (w_{p+1} v)$ of $w v$, *i.e.* the new word for $p+1$ is $w_{p+1} v$.
* if $p$ is odd, we construct the suffix $w_{d-1} \cdots (w_p v)$ of $w v$, *i.e.* the new word for $p$ is $w_{p+1} v$. 
The priority $p$ appears at least $\delta(wv)(p) = \delta(w)(p) + 1$ times.

This completes the proof of the invariant. Now, we argue that if a word is rejected by the automaton, then it contains an odd cycle,
which is the contrapositive of the first item. Let $wv$ such that $w$ is accepted and $wv$ is rejected.
Assume that $v$ has priority $p$, this implies that $\delta(w)(p) = n$. It follows that in $w_p w_{p-1} \cdots w_1 v$ the priority $p$ appears at least $n+1$ times,
and no larger priority appears. Since there are $n$ vertices, some vertex repeats twice, forming an odd cycle.


**Remark.**
The original proof of correctness of the small progress measure algorithm differs for the first item. It shows the following **global** property:

For all games with $n$ vertices and $d$ priorities, 
Eve wins, if, and only if, 
there exists a progress measure, which is a (partial) function $\mu : V \to [n]^{\frac{d}{2}}$ such that for all $v$ of priority $p$:
* if $v$ belongs to Eve, there exists $(v,v') \in E$ such that 
$$\mu(v) \le_p \mu(v'),$$
* if $v$ belongs to Adam, for all $(v,v') \in E$ we have 
$$\mu(v) \le_p \mu(v').$$

We see this as a **global** property, as opposed to the **local** (and dynamic) property $\text{AllEvenCycles} \subseteq L$.
We do not know of any non-convoluted way to prove one property using the other.







### <a name="succinct_progress">The succinct progress measure algorithm</a>
The fact that the succinct progress measures form a solution of the separation problem was not explicitely stated before this post, to the best of the author's knowledge.

Before constructing the automaton, we give some intuitions.
The small progress measure algorithm manipulates functions $\mu : V \to [n]^{\frac{d}{2}}$, 
which can be seen as trees of depth $\frac{d}{2}$ and branching directions $[n]$, where the leaves are labeled by vertices.
The *key* observation of Jurdzi&#324;ski and Lazi&#263; is that these trees are *only* used for lexicographic comparisons.
Hence we can encode them in a more succinct way supporting *only* this feature.

Let $k = \lceil \log(n) \rceil$ and $S_{n,d}$ the set of $\frac{d}{2}$-tuples of binary strings whose total length is at most $k$.
The components are numbered $1,3,\ldots,d-1$.
For a tuple $x$ and a priority $p$, we let $x(p)$ denote the $p$ component of $x$.
We order binary strings as follows: 
$$ 
0 s < \varepsilon \qquad ; \qquad \varepsilon <\ 1 s \qquad ; \qquad b s <\ b s' \Longleftrightarrow s <\ s'.
$$

We extend this order into a lexicographical order for tuples; more precisely we let $$\le_p$$ denote the lexicographic order restricted to the components larger than or equal to $p$,
and $<\_p$ the strict version. The order $\le_p$ is called the $p$-order.

The following lemma is the key technical tool of the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05051).

**Lemma (succinct tree coding).**
There exists a function $\enc$ taking as input a function $\mu : V \to [n]^{\frac{d}{2}}$
and outputting a function $\enc(\mu) : V \to S_{n,d}$ such that all $p$-orders are preserved:
for $\mu$, $v, v'$ and a priority $p$, we have
$$\mu(v) \le_p \mu(v')$$ if, anf only if, $$\enc(\mu)(v) \le_p \enc(\mu)(v').$$

We construct a (deterministic) safe automaton recognising a language $L$ solving the separation problem.
The set states of the automaton is $S_{n,d}$.
The initial state is the tuple containing only $\varepsilon$, written $x_0$.
The transition function is defined exactly as for small progress measures: from the tuple $x$, reading a vertex $v$ of priority $p$, the next tuple $x'$
is the smallest satisfying: 
* if $p$ is even, then $x \le_p x'$,
* if $p$ is odd, then $x <\_p x'$.

A more mechanistic point of view can be derived from this definition. Because of the condition that the total number of bits is $\log(n)$,
this is a bit tedious, see the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05051).

Formally, the transition function is $$\deltasucc : S_{n,d} \times V \to S_{n,d}$$, inducing $$\deltasucc : V^* \to S_{n,d}$$.

The automaton is safe: all states are accepting, and if a transition is undefined the automaton rejects.

For a word $w$ and a tuple $x$, we let $\deltasucc(x,w)$ denote the tuple reached after reading $w$ from $x$, if defined.
Then, $\deltasucc(w)$ is $\deltasucc(x_0,w)$.

**Lemma:**
1. $\text{AllEvenCycles} \subseteq L$
2. $L \cap \text{AllOddCycles} = \emptyset$
