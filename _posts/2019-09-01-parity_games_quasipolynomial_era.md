<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his post is an overview on my recent research related to the quasipolynomial time algorithms for parity games.
It can serve as a roadmap for various posts on this blog.
</p>

Another piece of material for these results is the [slides for my invited talk at GanDALF](https://nathanael-fijalkow.github.io/Talk/2019-09-03-GanDALF_parity/#/overview_start).

The key underlying combinatorial notion is that of **universal trees**.
**All** quasipolynomial algorithms (and some others) belong to one of three families: separating automata, value iteration, and fixed point.
Each algorithm in these families corresponds to the choice of a universal tree, which dictates its complexity.

Everything there is to know about universal trees can be found in [this post]({{ '/blog/universal_trees' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

The first family of algorithms, the closest to universal trees, is value iteration algorithms.
It is presented in [this post]({{ '/blog/value_iteration' | prepend: site.baseurl }}), and relies on the fundamental theorem for parity games presented in [this post]({{ '/blog/fundamental_theorem_parity_games' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

The second family of algorithms is described using separating automata.
It is presented in [this post]({{ '/blog/parity_separation' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
There are two aspects to be discussed. 
First, the separation question can come in two flavours, strong and weak, we refer to [this post]({{ '/blog/separation_strong_weak' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
Second, the definition of separating automata requires deterministic automata, which does not cover Lehtinen's approach; hence a more suitable notion, extending separating automata,
is **good for small games automata**. There are no blog posts on them (yet?), so we refer to [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-17127-8_1).

The first equivalence result states that separating automata and universal trees are equivalent. 
The original proof is this result is in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10546) -- it subsumes [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09618), which presents the generic value iteration algorithm using universal trees.
A conceptually simpler proof introduces and uses the notion of **universal graphs**, discussed in [this post]({{ '/blog/universal_graphs' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
One of the advantage of this new proof is that it applies to any positionally determined objective, as explained in [this post]({{ '/blog/separation_universal_graphs' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

Since the notion of universal graphs applies to much more objectives (said differently: universal trees are universal graphs for parity objectives), it opens many perspectives, of constructing new efficient algorithms for other games.
We discuss algorithms using universal graphs for mean payoff in [this post]({{ '/blog/mean_payoff' | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

Unfortunately there are no blog posts yet on the third family of algorithms.
The implied equivalence result stating that the mentioned fixed point algorithms feature a universal tree is ongoing work, 
with contributions of Marcin Jurdzi&#324;ski and RÃ©mi Morvan (through personal communication).
