<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he postulate of this post is that two algorithms for parity games, 
namely the small progress measure algorithm of Jurdzi&#324;ski and the power counting algorithm of Calude et al, 
are solutions of a separation problem.</p>

Let $V$ be a set of $n$ vertices and $d$ a number of priorities, we consider a priority function $V \to \set{1,\ldots,d}$.
We define three languages:
* $\text{Parity} \subseteq V^\omega$: the maximal priority appearing infinitely many times is even,
* $\text{AllEvenCycles} \subseteq V^\omega$: the maximal priority between any two repetitions of the same vertex is **even**,
* $\text{AllOddCycles} \subseteq V^\omega$: the maximal priority between any two repetitions of the same vertex is **odd**.

The separation problem reads: find a topologically closed (also known as safe) regular language $L \subseteq V^*$ such that

> 1. $\text{AllEvenCycles } \subseteq L$
> 2. $L \cap \text{ AllOddCycles} = \emptyset$

> **Theorem:** the winning regions of $\text{Parity}$ and $L$ coincide.

**Proof:** This relies on the positional determinacy of parity games.
A positional strategy ensuring $\text{Parity}$ ensures $\text{AllEvenCycles}$, hence $L$.
Conversely, a positional strategy ensuring the complement of $\text{Parity}$ ensures $\text{AllOddCycles}$, hence the complement of $L$.

It follows that solving the parity game is equivalent to solving a safety game of size $n \times |L|$, where $|L|$
is the number of states of $L$.

#### In the remainder of this note we explain that:
1. the small progress measure algorithm of Jurdzi&#324;ski is a solution of the separation problem with $\|L\| = O(n^{\frac{d}{2}})$,
2. the power counting algorithm of Calude et al is a solution of the separation problem with $\|L\| = O(n^{\log(d)})$,
3. the succint progress measure algorithm of Jurdzi&#324;ski and Lazi&#263; **does not** solve the separation problem.

The first point is well known, it's due to Julien Bernet, David Janin, and Igor Walukiewicz, in the paper 
[Permissive strategies: from parity games to safety games](www.labri.fr/perso/igw/Papers/igw-perm.ps).
They in particular hint at the separation problem in the conclusion.

The second point has been worked out by Miko&#322;aj Boja&#324;czyk and Wojtek Czerwi&#324;ski in their lecture notes
[An automata toolbox](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~bojan/20172018-2/advanced-topics-in-automata-20172018-jezyki-automaty-i-obliczenia-2).

We proceed to the third point.
